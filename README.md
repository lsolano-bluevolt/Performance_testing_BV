# Performance Testing for Bluevolt
The main goal of the performance testing in this case is to establish a health check mechanism that can run on a daily basis. This would provide the DevOps team with ongoing insights into the system's performance and potential bottlenecks.

It would also serve as an early warning system for performance degradation, allowing the team to address issues proactively before they impact the end users.

Specifically, we aim to:

Identify and analyze performance variations: By running the health check daily, we can track the performance metrics over time. This allows us to identify any trends, such as gradual slowdowns, and react accordingly. It also helps in identifying any sudden changes in performance.

Understand system behavior under slight slowdowns: In a real-world scenario, there might be times when the system slows down slightly due to increased traffic or other factors. The health check should simulate such scenarios and provide insights into how the system behaves under those conditions.

Ensure system robustness and reliability: The performance test should verify that the system can handle the expected load reliably without significant degradation in response times or other key metrics.

Establish performance baselines: The health check will establish a baseline for the system's performance. This can be used as a reference point for future changes, ensuring that any updates do not negatively impact the system's performance.

Performance Scenarios:

Given the structure of the app in two main modules: LearnerUI & Administration Page. We need to ensure an optimal user experience. We have this two first scenarios to execute the performancee

Login: The login function is typically the first interaction a user has with our system. It's essential that this feature works efficiently and quickly, as it forms the user's first impression of our application. We will therefore test this function under various load conditions to ensure its performance. Additionally, we need to confirm that even under heavy load, only authenticated users are granted access.

Home Page Loading: Once the user has successfully logged in, the next crucial interaction is the loading of the home page. We need to ensure that this page loads quickly and efficiently, even under high traffic conditions, as it serves as the main navigation hub for our users.
